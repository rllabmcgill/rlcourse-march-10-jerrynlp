Tile Coding

From Weiwei Zhang (260 684 686)

In this assignment I implemented the tile coding method and evaluate it in a large scale CliffWalking environment and a parameter estimation experiment of a Plane based on Tensorflow.

File list,
1. TileCoding.ipynb is my code and experiment results.
2. TileCoding.pdf is the slides.
3. tilecoding.py is a testable python script.
